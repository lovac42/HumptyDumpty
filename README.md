AnkiAddon: Convert V1-V2; Keep learning cards intact

## About:
This addon converts between V1 and V2 while keeping learning cards intact. There should be no problems upgrading from V1 to V2, however, downgrading back to V1 from V2 requires some missing values to be recalculated.

If you're not playing around, then you only need to use it once, from V1 to V2 and can safely remove this addon. (Hence the title...)

Please read the source code first before deciding if this is the right addon for you.

## Instruction:
Preferences > Experimental V2 scheduler
